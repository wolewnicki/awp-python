# Project Requirments

## we are going to write a randomizer for music chords

## there are `qualties` for music chords (ie: major, minor diminshed)

## there are `keys` for music chords (ie: Ab, A, Bb, C)

## we can break these apart to generate a string like `C natural minor`

- `C locrain`
- `C blues`
- `C Natural Major`
- `Ab Natural minors`
- `C harmonic minor`

*to include: major, natural minor, harmonic minor, melodic minor, dorian,*
*phrygian, lydian, mixolydian, locrian, major pentatonic, minor pentatonic,*
*whole tone, WH diminished, HW diminished, blues, bebop minor*
